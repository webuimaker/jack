		<strong>If you’re reading this, your situation most likely falls into one of the following four categories:</strong>
		<ol class="pl-0">
			<li>1. Your wife knows about your cuckold or hotwife fantasy and is willing to fantasize about it in bed, but isn’t willing to actually explore it in real life.</li>
			<li>2. Your wife knows about your cuckold or hotwife fantasy, and is not willing to fantasize about it in bed because she doesn’t like it or even understand it for that matter.</li>
			<li>3. Your wife knows about your cuckold or hotwife fantasy and has explored it with you in the past, but no longer wants to again for whatever reason(s).</li>
			<li>4. Your wife doesn’t know about your cuckold or hotwife fantasy because you haven’t brought it up to her yet.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Because each of those situations is different, they each call for taking a different approach in order to get your wife to "take the plunge". In order to make sure you don't waste your time reading information that won't apply to your unique situation, I'm going to suggest that you complete my FREE Cuckold/Hotwife Probability Assessment.

		<h4>WARNING: Both the free and paid resources and services on this site are EXTREMELY effective.  </h4>
		<p>If you're not serious about making your fantasy a reality, then you probably shouldn't be here. The methods and techniques I teach WILL work for you in your situation. That's one of the biggest reasons why my site has lasted this long and continues to grow in popularity (I actually now do this professionally for a living). If you want to make your fantasy happen though, you've come to the right place.</p>
		
		<h4>Hello And Welcome</h4>
		<p>
		I’m Dr. 36, The Cuckold Consultant & owner of The Cuckold Consultant® site .  I made it my mission to help men just like you make your cuckold or hotwife fantasy happen in a way that fits you, your relationship, your wife's personality and objections, and your goals. Today, The Cuckold Consultant® site is filled with invaluable resources to help you get started to take the right steps to make your cuckold or hotwife fantasy happen so your wife will finally sleep with other men, whether that’s helping you introduce the topic in a way where she doesn't reject you, bypassing the resistance she's given you thus far, or navigating any other problems keeping you from living out your fantasy in reality the way you want.</p>
<p>I know that one solution won't work for everyone. That’s why I offer many many services, from my articles and assessments, helpful reports, and step-by-step guides, to my customized cuckold/hotwife consulting that addresses your special needs. With my personalized consulting services, I'm able to get to know you one-on-one and write a Personalized Cuckold/Hotwife Plan™—a "manual"— just for you and work with you to ensure adequate guidance, support, and a successful result.</p>
<p>Trying to repress your fantasy or satisfy in other ways like porn and forums can be harmful to your relationship. Just know you're not alone! You can think of me as a virtual extension of your “relationship support system.” My cuckold consulting approach is built around your needs, your relationship style, and your wife's personality. I'll work together with you to develop a plan that will help you make your fantasy happen and give you the relationship and sex life you've always wanted.</p>
<p>All the best, <br>
Dr. 36</p>		

<p>P.S. For those of you who want to know more about who I am and how/why I can help, I've written an extensive "autobiography" of sorts on my <a href="#">about me page</a>. </p>
