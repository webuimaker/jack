She thinks you want to sleep with other women.

She thinks the idea is weird. 

She is uncomfortable with the idea in general. 

She doesn't understand how or why you would want to share her. 

She doesn't think you really love her because you want to share her. 

She said it's fun to think about but she would never do it in reality. 

She's afraid other people will find out. 

She said your children were an obstacle for some reason. 

She doesn't feel good enough about herself physically or mentally to want to do it. 

She's objected on religious grounds. 

She thinks it's cheating. 

She's worried you won't like her if she did it. 

She's worried about liking it too much. 

She's worried about not liking it at all. 

She's worried one or both of you will regret it. 

She doesn't think it's possible due to logistical reasons (when would it happen, how, where, etc)

She said she needs an emotional connection with people before having sex with them. 

She said it wouldn't be healthy for the relationship.

She's worried something can go wrong (i.e. what if she falls for the other guy).

	<p>Everyone knows women can be pretty complicated. Not to mention, trying to get your wife to try a fantasy this taboo is like navigating a minefeld because of how worried most women are when it comes to fantasies that go "outside the marriage."</p><p>

So it's no wonder why most guys get stopped dead in their tracks by their wife's objections.</p><p>

And no matter how legitimate or silly the objections she gives you... there you are, defeated by her resistance... and that rejection can make you feel like a melted blob on the floor.</p>

Perhaps you don't give up immediately though. Maybe you try to "reason" with your wife, maybe you try to logically convince her it's not cheating, or that you won't eventually want to sleep with other women...

Problem is, it doesn't get you anywhere does it?

Such a logical approach is seldom effective. In fact, it can make her become even more entrenched in what she already thinks, and now I'm going to tell you why.

It's all because of how the brain is structured. Science has long since demonstrated through EEG, fMRI, and other various neuroimaging techniques that the brain can be divided into two parts. There's the part of the brain that uses and responds to logic and reason, and there's the part that uses and responds to emotion.

	<p>This matters because men are wired such that the logic and reason part of their brain dominates. Women are wired such that the emotional part of their brain dominates, especially when it comes to emotional topics and issues.<p><p>

So it's natural for women to make decisions about emotional topics and issues by using the emotional parts of their brain. And guess what?</p><p>

Because sexual fantasies are an emotional topic, if you're trying to use logic and reason to address your wife's objections, you'll fail every time because you'll be trying to talk to a part of her brain that plays no role in her feelings about all this.</p>

This is why trying to convince your wife that this isn't a way for you to sleep with other women doesn't work. It's why trying to convince your wife that you want to do this because you love her (not because you don't love) her doesn't work. It's why trying to convince your wife she is attractive or sexy when she doesn't think she is doesn't work!

Using logic and reason won't work because women literally aren't wired to respond to logic and reason about emotional topics and issues. I have some good news for you though...

{{% align heading_number="3" heading_content="Here's The Real Solution"  class="center" %}}  {{% /align %}}

What if I told you that there was a way to **get your wife to lower her resistance? What if  I told you it was possible to get her to willingly change her mind** and want to give your fantasy a try? Would you want to know what that way is?

If you've read this far, I think it's safe to say you do, so I'm going to tell you.

The solution is to approach all this in a way that uses emotional reasoning, emotional rationale, and emotional sequencing. Don't know what this means? No problem because I'm going to explain it, and once I do, you'll be surprised at just how easy it is to use, and you can then lead your wife to willingly explore many things with you, including your fantasy.

That's rightâ€”now you can finally get your wife to let her inhibitions go and to embrace her sexuality completely. I'm going to show you exactly what to say and do to make your fantasy happen so you can finally become a true hotwife husband, stag, or cuckold.

Allow me to introduce The Cuckold's Compass Objection Guide.
