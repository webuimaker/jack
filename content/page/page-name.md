She thinks you want to sleep with other women.

She doesn't understand why you have this fantasy.

She thinks the idea is weird. 

She is uncomfortable with the idea in general. 

She doesn't understand how or why you would want to share her. 

She doesn't think you really love her because you want to share her. 

She said it's fun to think about but she would never do it in reality. 

She's afraid other people will find out. 

She said your children were an obstacle for some reason. 

She doesn't feel good enough about herself physically or mentally to want to do it. 

She's objected on religious grounds. 

She thinks it's cheating. 

She's worried you won't like her if she did it. 

She's worried about liking it too much. 

She's worried about not liking it at all. 

She's worried one or both of you will regret it. 

She doesn't think it's possible due to logistical reasons (when would it happen, how, where, etc)

She said she needs an emotional connection with people before having sex with them. 

She said it wouldn't be healthy for the relationship.

She's worried something can go wrong (i.e. what if she falls for the other guy). 

If any of these sound familiar, and you haven't been able to get past your wife's objections to make your fantasy happen, then this webpage is for you!

{{< content src="/images/minefield.jpg" class="right-image"   >}}
	<p>Everyone knows women can be pretty complicated. Not to mention, trying to get your wife to try a fantasy this taboo is like navigating a minefeld because of how worried most women are when it comes to fantasies that go "outside the marriage."</p><p>

So it's no wonder why most guys get stopped dead in their tracks by their wife's objections.</p><p>

And no matter how legitimate or silly the objections she gives you... there you are, defeated by her resistance... and that rejection can make you feel like a melted blob on the floor.</p>
{{< /content >}}

Perhaps you don't give up immediately though. Maybe you try to "reason" with your wife, maybe you try to logically convince her it's not cheating, or that you won't eventually want to sleep with other women...

Problem is, it doesn't get you anywhere does it?

Such a logical approach is seldom effective. In fact, it can make her become even more entrenched in what she already thinks, and now I'm going to tell you why.

{{% align heading_number="3" heading_content="Here's The Real Problem..."  class="center" %}}  {{% /align %}}

It's all because of how the brain is structured. Science has long since demonstrated through EEG, fMRI, and other various neuroimaging techniques that the brain can be divided into two parts. There's the part of the brain that uses and responds to logic and reason, and there's the part that uses and responds to emotion.


{{< content src="/images/tumblr_inline_ovccon1bUp1uv3z4o_1280.jpg" class="left-image" borderColor="" borderStyle="" backgroundColor=""  >}}
	<p>This matters because men are wired such that the logic and reason part of their brain dominates. Women are wired such that the emotional part of their brain dominates, especially when it comes to emotional topics and issues.<p><p>

So it's natural for women to make decisions about emotional topics and issues by using the emotional parts of their brain. And guess what?</p><p>

Because sexual fantasies are an emotional topic, if you're trying to use logic and reason to address your wife's objections, you'll fail every time because you'll be trying to talk to a part of her brain that plays no role in her feelings about all this.</p>
{{< /content >}}

This is why trying to convince your wife that this isn't a way for you to sleep with other women doesn't work. It's why trying to convince your wife that you want to do this because you love her (not because you don't love) her doesn't work. It's why trying to convince your wife she is attractive or sexy when she doesn't think she is doesn't work!

Using logic and reason won't work because women literally aren't wired to respond to logic and reason about emotional topics and issues. I have some good news for you though...

{{% align heading_number="3" heading_content="Here's The Real Solution"  class="center" %}}  {{% /align %}}

What if I told you that there was a way to **get your wife to lower her resistance? What if  I told you it was possible to get her to willingly change her mind** and want to give your fantasy a try? Would you want to know what that way is?

If you've read this far, I think it's safe to say you do, so I'm going to tell you.

The solution is to approach all this in a way that uses emotional reasoning, emotional rationale, and emotional sequencing. Don't know what this means? No problem because I'm going to explain it, and once I do, you'll be surprised at just how easy it is to use, and you can then lead your wife to willingly explore many things with you, including your fantasy.

That's right—now you can finally get your wife to let her inhibitions go and to embrace her sexuality completely. I'm going to show you exactly what to say and do to make your fantasy happen so you can finally become a true hotwife husband, stag, or cuckold.

Allow me to introduce The Cuckold's Compass Objection Guide.

{{< content src="" class="" borderColor="#eada95" borderStyle="solid" backgroundColor="#faf2d3" width="60%"  >}}
<p >Just imagine finally being able to get your wife to open her mind to flirting and sleeping with other men&nbsp;<strong>in reality.</strong></p>
<p >At first, you might notice&nbsp;<strong>she'll begin to ask you</strong>&nbsp;to role-play cuckolding/hotwifing scenarios in the bedroom.</p>
<p >You won't have to convince her to&nbsp;<strong>dress more revealing</strong>&nbsp;when you're out in public with her because she'll have beaten you to it.</p>
<p >As she enjoys her newfound confidence and&nbsp;<strong>lowers her inhibitions</strong>, she'll start to enjoy the prospect of finding a guy to flirt with so she can tell you/tease you about it later.</p>
<p>And that's just the beginning.</p>
<p >Would it turn you on if she sent&nbsp;<strong>sexy photos</strong>&nbsp;of herself to other men she finds on online dating sites?</p>
<p >Would it excite you if she eventually confessed that the idea of going to a bar and picking up a stranger&nbsp;<strong>made her wet?</strong></p>
<p >Hopefully, because things don't need to stop there!</p>
<p ">Imagine the orgasmic thrill you would have from knowing&nbsp;<strong>your wife gave a blowjob</strong>&nbsp;to that supportive co-worker she talks about from time to time…</p>
<p >Or knowing she was&nbsp;<strong>fucking a steady lover</strong>&nbsp;a few times a week with your permission...</p>
<p >Or maybe you even want to experience what it's like to be&nbsp;<strong>mercilessly cucked time and again</strong>&nbsp;with different men, knowing you no longer have any control over what she does and doesn't do...</p>

These things are only possible if you can make some headway with the objections she's given you. And the way to make some headway is to handle her objections in the right way.

**Here's what others have to say...**

{{% align heading_number="3" heading_content=""  class="center" %}}
<p>
"Yea I was definitely handling her objections in the wrong way. As soon as I used some of the techniques you talked about, I could feel a shift in her attitude towards the entire fantasy. It was only about 4 or 5 weeks after I followed the methods within that I got her to agree to us looking online for a well hung guy who she'd be willing to have sex with. After that, it was all assess and elbows as they say!!"</p>

<p>- Pete W</p>
<p>"She said the fact that she felt understood is what made her feel like it was actually ok to think about the idea. Just a week later, we've now started doing some role play in the bedroom with it!"</p>
<p>- Allan S.</p>

<p>"My wife and I have been married for 24 years, and she's a fairly religious person. She's no bible thumper but she's the moral type. I was afraid to bring this idea up at first, but I decided one day I would at least try. It went down like I thought though. She didn't understand, thought I wanted to be swingers, said it was cheating, all that kind of stuff. This went on for a little until I stopped bringing it up. But then I found your site since I was searching for cuckolding stories to read. I took a look around, downloaded the free guide and since what you said in it made perfect sense I figured why not try the objection guide. Well, I'm one to be skeptical of reviews, but let me tell everyone out there, this manual is worth getting. I never thought I'd see the day where my wife was willing to go down this road with me. But here we are...she's since been on 4 dates, slept with one of them, and got to third base with another. And we can't keep our hands off each other. I'm not as religious as my wife, so instead of thanking god, I thank YOU Dr.36!"</p>
<p>- Ernest</p>

<p>"I finally was able to get her to go out on her own and go on a date with a guy she met online. The best part was that she said she enjoyed it and would be open to doing it again!"</p>
<p>
EDIT: "Reconnecting with my wife after that first date was fun, but it was nothing compared to reconnecting with her after she officially fooled around with one of her dates. She gave him a blowjob in the car in the parking lot of the restaurant they had dinner in! And she swallowed. The doors that have been opened because of all this are just incredible to me, I love it, and so does she."</p>
<p>- Sissyhub7792</p>
<p>"Much better information than everything else out there on the web. Your understanding of Psychology is unquestionable."</p><p>
