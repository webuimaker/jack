#### Did You Know That The Large Majority Of Women Are Biologically Hardwired To Be Turned On By The Idea Of Sleeping With Someone Who Isn’t Their Primary Mate?

If you have trouble believing this, then you won’t by the time you reach the end of this post. Let’s take a trip down one of the lanes of Evolutionary Psychology.

Back in the day when we were hunters and gatherers…a time when life was quite dangerous and uncertain; a time when if you were a man you risked getting your head smashed in with a rock just for talking to the wrong woman; a time when if you were a woman you risked your mate abandoning you because he found another woman (which he was wired to look for)…it was during this time that survival and replication was the name of the game.

That’s why you had to be careful, especially if you were a woman because women didn’t survive alone in those times. They therefore had to make decisions that would increase their chances of survival. And because it wouldn’t make much sense to survive in order to just have weak offspring, they also had to keep the future of their offspring in mind.

One of the best ways to increase your odds of surviving and replicating successfully was to align yourself with an alpha male by mating with him. Why? Because alpha males were the most likely to survive, and they had the best genes too.

So naturally, women who were wired to seek out (aka be attracted to) the alpha male of the group had better odds of surviving and replicating successfully.

It goes to say that women who were wired to seek out alpha males and mate with them were more likely to pass their genes on, and women who were not wired this way were more likely to have their genes unapologetically weeded out of existence.

This means that evolution also favored the survival and replication of that wiring in women that caused them to be attracted to and want to mate with alpha males. So let’s bring it back to what I said in the beginning of this post.

Statistically speaking, beta males vastly outnumber alpha males. This is the way it is and has always been. That means the majority of women aren’t with an alpha male…

But just because there’s no more chocolate cake left doesn’t mean your affinity for chocolate cake goes away. Sure you’ll settle for a piece of vanilla cake, and you’ll even enjoy the vanilla cake, but that doesn’t mean your desire for chocolate cake isn’t still inside you like a splinter in your mind.

That wiring that we talked about above still exists. And that’s why it’s not incorrect to say the majority of women are biologically hardwired to be turned on by the idea of sleeping with someone who isn’t their primary mate because statistically speaking, their mate isn’t an alpha male.

So let me ask you a question: Are you an alpha male? Or more importantly, does your wife consider you to be an alpha male? If the answer to either of these questions isn’t an unequivocal yes, then I would wager my house on the fact that she’s had desires to sleep with someone else over the course of her relationship with you.

Now think about what this means for the possibility of your fantasy…

Perhaps you’re closer to being a cuckold than you might think…
