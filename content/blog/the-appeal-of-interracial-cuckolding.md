## Preamble & Definitional Parameters

What is Interracial Cuckolding, and why is it so appealing to so many men? (The [Interracial Room of Cuckold Chat](https://www.thecuckoldconsultant.com/cuckold-chat) for example has been steadily growing and has recently become the second most popular room on the chat.)

In order to answer the first part of the question, we have to make a few things clear. First, the word interracial when used in this context will refer to the interpersonal relating of a white woman with a black man.

Second, the word cuckolding when used in this context will hearken back to the [definition of a cuckold](https://www.thecuckoldconsultant.com/articles/what-is-a-cuckold/), and hence will refer to an arrangement where a submissive man (or a man with a submissive side) derives masochistic, erotic pleasure from his female partner having sex with another man.

Those things having been made clear, interracial cuckolding can thus be defined as a sub-niche/shade of cuckolding where a man’s primary female partner, who is “white”, has sex with another man, who is black.



Now onto the second (and more interesting) part of the question: why is interracial cuckolding so appealing to so many people?

Before we get into the details of this, I want to unequivocally state a few things on the record:

- This article isn’t composed of just random ideas from my head. The theories that follow are meant to be the syntheses of what I’ve learned from studying this fantasy (and those with an affinity for it) over the last decade or so.
- This article isn’t meant to capture *every* nuance of the “etiology” of interracial cuckolding. In other words, if a/the reason you find interracial cuckolding appealing isn’t in this article, that’s ok. As universal or general as some desires and their etiologies are, individual discrepancies and nuances will always exist.
- Please understand this article isn’t meant to put you or your desires into a box as much as it is to help give you some insight as to why you (or others) have an affinity for interracial cuckolding.
- Now with that said and out of the way, let’s move on.
- The appeal of interracial cuckolding can be broken down into two levels: the surface level, and the below-the-surface level.

#### The Surface & What’s Below

![/images/blog/bigdata-1024x576.jpg](/images/blog/bigdata-1024x576.jpg)

The surface level reasons aren’t that exciting. For example, many cucks find the thought of their milky white wife having sex with a black man appealing because of the skin color contrast; to them, it’s a hot and sexually arousing sight. And that’s about as deep as it goes. You don’t choose what sexually stimulates you, and sometimes “a cigar is just a cigar” as the anti-Freudian saying goes.

For others though, the appeal of interracial cuckolding goes much deeper and can have its roots in any or all of the following elements: the appeal of what is considered taboo, the amplification of masochistic erotic pleasure due to perceptual contrast, and the desire to experience hyper-humiliation. Let’s discuss each of these in detail.

#### The Taboo

![/images/blog/taboo-interracial.jpg](/images/blog/taboo-interracial.jpg)
As is well known, what is taboo is can be sexually arousing for many people. And there is certainly a taboo element in interracial cuckolding. How?

Historically speaking, black males have been (unfairly, ignorantly, and prejudicially) viewed by many as being dangerous/impure and less human than white males, especially in the United States. There was a time when it was considered so taboo for a black man and a white woman to have marital and/or intimate relations that the United states even enforced anti-miscegenation laws.

To be sure, modern-day society has come a long way in adopting more egalitarian/less racist attitudes towards black men (and in abolishing many of these anti-miscegenation laws)—but we’ve still a long way to go. Heck, even in the porn industry there is a certain stigma attached to having sex with a black male, as evidenced by the results of a [2016 survey done by Jon Milward](http://jonmillward.com/blog/studies/deep-inside-a-study-of-10000-porn-stars/) which reported that 87% of porn actresses are willing to take a facial, but only 53% will do interracial porn.

To be sure, modern-day society has come a long way in adopting more egalitarian/less racist attitudes towards black men (and in abolishing many of these anti-miscegenation laws)—but we’ve still a long way to go. Heck, even in the porn industry there is a certain stigma attached to having sex with a black male, as evidenced by the results of a [2016 survey done by Jon Milward](http://jonmillward.com/blog/studies/deep-inside-a-study-of-10000-porn-stars/) which reported that 87% of porn actresses are willing to take a facial, but only 53% will do interracial porn.

To further support this are first-person reports such as those from Sophie Dee who said in a 2010 interview that agents often pressure white female performers not to appear in interracial pornography; Aurora Snow saying in a [2013 article](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/03/05/interracial-sex-still-taboo-for-many-porn-stars.html) that the major factor preventing many white actresses from doing interracial scenes is “career anxiety”; Tee Reel, male porn star [saying he’s had off-camera sex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_pornography#cite_note-beast-11) with some female performers who don’t do interracial scenes; the list goes on.

I reference all that to make the following point clear: at the end of the day, whether you want to say the taboo of interracial sex is more/less in full form or vestigial, it obviously plays a role in why the evocation and fetishism of black male / white female interracial relationships are sexually arousing. This would obviously be amplified in situations where a white woman chooses to have sex with a black man over her husband, since there are double layer taboos there (interracial sex + cuckolding, both taboo).

#### Perceptual Contrast


![/images/blog/Perceptual-Contrast.jpg](/images/blog/Perceptual-Contrast.jpg)

If you put your left hand in a bowl of cold water and your right in hot water, leave them there for a while, and then plunge both together into a bowl of lukewarm water, the left will surprisingly feel hot while the right will surprisingly feel cold.


Put light next to dark and it seems lighter. A stale smell will seem worse after a sweet smell. This is the principle of perceptual contrast by which our senses work. The same effect also applies to more our complex cognitive constructions—including the appeal of interracial cuckolding. How?

As we stated earlier, a cuckold derives masochistic, erotic pleasure from his female partner having sex with another man. Much of this masochistic pleasure has its roots certain “cuck-worthy” attributes / failings / feelings: the cuck’s penis is too small, his wife wants/deserves more or better sex than he can provide, etc. It logically follows that in an arrangement where one’s primary female partner is sleeping with another man, the more masculine the other man is compared to the husband, the more amplified is the masochistic, erotic pleasure he experiences due to the perceptual contrast principle. Enter interracial cuckolding.

The fetishized contrast between the “beta” cuck and an “alpha” masculine man is especially relevant here because in interracial cuckolding fantasies, black males are (stereotypically) fantasized to be hyper-masculine; they are portrayed to have bigger penises, muscular bodies, to be virile and promiscuous, more dominant with women, etc. Whether or not these stereotypes are true is for a different discussion. The stereotypes exist in the popular conceptualization of the fantasy—and that’s all that matters here when it comes to creating and feeding a fetish/fantasy.

Interracial cuckolding thus amplifies certain psycho-sexually arousing feelings, particularly ones that have their roots in falling short when it comes to sexual comparisons/competitiveness.

Last but not least regarding this element, there seems to be, as there is with many fantasy elements, a progressive nature to it. What I mean by that can be seen on the internet and in some of the more “extreme” interracial content in the [Interracial Room of Cuckold Chat](https://www.thecuckoldconsultant.com/cuckold-chat). For example, the contrast between the white beta cucks and the black alpha males borders on (and at times crosses into) a dysreality or a faux reality of sorts. Both races are caricatured in ways that hyperbolically exaggerate just how worthless and wimpy white men are, and just how superior and alpha black men are. This contrast culminates in an imagined future where black men take all the white women and breed the white race out of extinction.

Far out, I know. But this is a judgement free zone—at least when it comes to sexual fantasies.

#### Hyper-humiliation

![/images/blog/disgrace-coverage.jpg](/images/blog/disgrace-coverage.jpg)

For this next element, you’ll need to put your Archie Bunker hat on.


So, due to the rather outdated (but still somewhat existent) notion that black males are at the bottom of the racial hierarchy when it comes to…racial-social status, shall we say…if a black male sleeps with a white male’s white female partner, the white male (the cuckold) experiences an additional element of humiliation, hyper-humiliation if you will. That additional element is of a racial-social status nature. Here’s what I mean by that.

A white male is/was “supposed to” be at the top of the racial-social hierarchy. But, when a woman, his woman, chooses to bed a black male over him, it sends the message that he has been replaced/his role has been usurped by someone who is “supposed to” be/have been racially-socially inferior. To elaborate, it’s typically humiliating on its own for your female partner to choose to stray in general, but there’s an added element of humiliation when she chooses someone “lower” than you on the social hierarchy.

Taken to the extreme (as you’ll sometimes see depicted in the pictures and stories people share in the [Interracial Room of Cuckold Chat](https://www.thecuckoldconsultant.com/cuckold-chat)), the interracial cuckolding fantasy renders white men as helpless, humiliated, and ineffectual while their white women are being “defiled” and taken…all while these white wives give their orgasmic consent. So what’s more humiliating than the woman you love choosing someone else, someone of an “inferior” race, over you?

(Getting into the why behind why someone would want to experience these kinds of feelings has more to do with cuckolding in general. It’s beyond the scope of this article to cover the appeal of cuckolding in a more general sense, but to briefly summarize and not leave you hanging, being a cuckold provides one with an intoxicating emotional and psychological high that he likes to experience for two reasons:

- to feel alive, since engaging in cuckolding causes him to want his partner again with all the intensified feelings about risk and possible denial, and
- to feel diminished (humiliated), sometimes via experiencing a loss of control; indeed, humiliation serves as a release from tensions caused by the constant need to maintain and furthermore defend our dignity. One can finally give in and admit his shortcomings and limitations, and he can then feel unburdened due to shedding the oppressive constructs of the self.)

To be clear, The Cuckold Consultant website does not endorse racism or racial prejudices in any way, shape, or form. This article is merely meant to shed some light on some of the deeper, more twisted psycho-sexual appeals of interracial cuckolding.

#### Ambivalence

![/images/blog/6b060f12-37d8-4780-ae3d-8853e7c24b34._SX368_.jpg](/images/blog/6b060f12-37d8-4780-ae3d-8853e7c24b34._SX368_.jpg)

If you’ve been reading carefully and thinking critically so far, you might be wondering if its possible for someone to simultaneously experience hyper-humiliation for the reasons described above while on some level also envy black men due to their masculinity, virility, and sexual prowess. The answer is yes and has to do with a psychological phenomenon known as ambivalence. (Sidenote: this phenomenon is present to a certain degree in more general kinds of racial fetishism where the “other” is both demonized and idolized. )


Ambivalence can be defined as the experience of having simultaneous conflicting reactions, beliefs, or feelings towards something or someone. Ambivalence is what is responsible for phenomena like:

- love-hate relationships
- why red (conservative) states who are opposed to gay rights have higher rates of gay pornography consumption
- Stockholm Syndrome
- how people can view black men as racially-socially “less than” while simultaneously fetishizing them and putting them on a pedestal regarding their sexual prowess.  

In other words, ambivalence makes it possible to paradoxically view black men as “inferior” and “superior” at the same time. This allows someone who fantasizes about interracial cuckolding to experience both the psycho-sexual pleasure of hyper-humiliation and the amplification of the comparative/competitive masochistic-erotic pleasures of cuckolding via the perceptual contrast principle.


#### Tying It All Together

So, if you’re into interracial cuckolding, does it mean all of the above things apply to you? No. Unequivocally just no.

The thrill and arousal some guys have has absolutely nothing to do with any hyper-humiliation they would otherwise experience due to thinking about black males as inferior. Rather, the thrill and arousal for them comes directly from the perceptual contrast of themselves feeling so markedly inferior to black males in a variety of areas (penis size, sexual stamina, sexual prowess, etc).


Other guys will find that the thrill and arousal they experience has nothing to do with that perceptual contrast. Rather the thrill and arousal for them comes from feeling that they’ve been disgraced as they’ve been sexually replaced by someone of an “inferior” race. It’s humiliating and there is nothing they can do about it.

Others yet are just so turned on at the taboo element of it all because as accepting as society has become, interracial relationships still aren’t considered i(n certain states and/or among certain groups of people) as “acceptable” (much less celebrated) as non-interracial relationships.

So to echo what I said at the beginning of the article, perhaps you have your own unique and personal reasons for why you have an affinity for seeing/imagining the woman you love filled with some big, black, cock. If you feel none of the above applied to you and want to share these reasons, feel free to leave some comments in the comment section below.

Last but not least, you may have noticed this article didn’t touch upon why many women find interracial cuckolding to be such a powerful fantasy. That’s for the subject of a future article 😉
