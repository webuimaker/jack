In one of my products, I take a pretty clear stand on the supposed prevalence of the cuckold/hotwife desire for males by asserting:

> “It stands to follow that the men who have these fantasies aren’t bizarre or perverted or deviant—they’re the norm; men who say they don’t have them are liars.”

In case that’s not crystal clear, what I’m saying is that the large majority of men get turned on by the idea of their female partners having sex with others.

But instead of expecting you to take just my own personal word for it, I’d rather give you some research which supports my assertion. Below is an excerpt from a research paper from the scientific journal Review Of General Psychology. For those who want the easy to digest summary, you can skip the actual excerpt below and read the paragraphs immediately after.

<p>"Pound (2002) hypothesized that men...should be more aroused by pornography incorporating cues of sperm competition than by comparable material in which such cues are absent. Content analyses of pornographic images on World Wide Web sites and of commercial "adult" video releases revealed that depictions of sexual activity involving a female and multiple males are more prevalent than those involving a male and multiple females, indicating that the former category maybe preferred by men.</p>
<p>"In addition, an online survey of self-reported preferences and an online preference study that unobtrusively assessed image selection behavior yielded corroborative results. Pound argued that the most parsimonious explanation for such results is that male arousal in response to visual cues of sperm competition risk reflects the functioning of psychological mechanisms that would have motivated adaptive patterns of copulatory behavior in ancestral males exposed to evidence of female promiscuity."
