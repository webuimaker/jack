Great news, Ladies & Gents!

Earlier today, we launched Cuckold Chat’s 2FA integration. What is 2FA?

2FA stands for 2-Factor Authentication. It’s an extra layer of security used to make sure that people trying to gain access to an online account are who they say they are. In other words, first a user will enter their username and a password. Then, instead of immediately gaining access to their account, they will be required to provide another piece of information—a second factor of authentication, if you will.

The most popular form of 2-Factor Authentication uses a software-generated time-based, one-time passcode (also called [TOTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm), or “soft-token”). That’s just fancy talk to say that after you enter your username and password, you’ll then be prompted to input another passcode provided to you by a third party app integrated with the site you’re trying to log into. Here’s a quick GIF showing you what I mean:

See how after the person enters their username and password they get prompted to enter a 6 digit passcode? That other 6 digit (time sensitive one-time) passcode is the second factor. Hence the name 2-Factor Authentication.

Now before I go on, I want to make something very clear…

Please understand that you do NOT need to enable/use this new 2FA feature in order to use the chat. Nothing is changing or has changed with how you log in. Everything is still exactly the same. We are simply providing this extra security feature as a courtesy because we believe in doing everything we can to protect your safety, security, and privacy. To be sure, none of those things were or are in jeopardy. We just like continuing to improve your user experience here. So, if you want to take advantage of this new feature, great! If not, that’s cool too.

Ok. Now that we’ve cleared that up, back to the one-time passcodes. More specifically, where does one get these time-sensitive one-time passcodes? From a secure TOTP generator of course, aka a trusted third party app. Cuckold Chat has chosen to integrate the official Google Authenticator App (found by [clicking here for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2), or found by [clicking here for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605)) with our chat software. That Google Authenticator App will provide you with the one-time passcodes.

All that said, we’re onto how to enable 2FA for your account on the chat.

#### Enabling 2FA For Your Cuckold Chat Account

The process is pretty simple. Go to your profile, then click the settings tab. You’ll now see a button that says Two-Factor Authentication. Click on it.

After clicking on that button, you’ll be brought to a new page. Below is a pic of what you’ll see.

This is the part which actually allows you to enable 2FA for your account. **Please note: do *NOT* click the + button until you have installed the Google Authenticator App on your phone/device.**


Regardless of whether or not you use the chat on your phone, pc, or other device(s), we recommend you install the Google Authenticator app on your phone. This will mean that any time you log into the chat, your phone must be handy. Is this a little inconvenient? Maybe, but it’s like 10 extra seconds of work with the payoff of making things way more secure.

_What follows is what you do *after* you have the Google Authenticator app installed on your phone/device._

Provided you have the Google Authenticator App on your phone/device, you’ll then enter a description for the device you installed it on (eg iPhone, Tablet, PC, etc), and then you’ll click the + .

After clicking the +, a prompt will come up with a QR Code and a secret key. Leave it on the screen. Do *not* click continue yet.

You’ll then open the Google Authenticator App on your phone and click the “+” in the upper right. It’ll give you the option to scan the QR code using your device or you can click “Manual entry” and enter the secret key. We strongly recommend scanning the QR code.

After scanning the QR code or entering the secret key, you’ll then see a 6 digit number in the app with the words Cuckold Chat and your username. Now go back to the chat screen page with the QR code you saw. Click the continue button.

You should now see an empty box prompting you to enter a 6 digit code. You’ll look back at the Google Authenticator app and enter the current 6 digits you see on the app at that time into the space provided on the chat. After you do so, 2FA will have been enabled.

To test it out, simply log out of your account, and then try logging back in. Provided you did everything correctly, after you enter your username and password, you’ll be prompted to enter the most current 6 digit code found on the Google Authenticator App for Cuckold Chat (2FA codes are randomly generated every 20-30 seconds and they change for security purposes). After you do that, you’ll then be in the chat like normal!

If you have any questions, please contact a staff member and let them know.
