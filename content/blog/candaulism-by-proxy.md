[Candaulism](https://www.thecuckoldconsultant.com/articles/why-do-men-want-to-expose-their-wives/) is a sexual practice or fantasy in which a man exposes his female partner, or images of her, to other people for their voyeuristic pleasure.



But what is it called when a man seeks someone else to take control of exposing or showing off his wife’s pictures so he’s no longer in control of them, resulting in that someone else now being able to show and expose these pictures however THEY want?


Until this very moment, there was no official term or terms to describe this practice. This article is therefore an attempt at suggesting an official term for the above-mentioned practice, which I’ll refer to from now on as Candaulism-By-Proxy. Let’s take a deeper look into what Candaulism-By-Proxy entails.

In Candaulism-By-Proxy, there are at least two parties involved. Party A is the owner of the pictures. He derives some kind of sexual pleasure from knowing others enjoy pictures of his wife. Party A also has a part of him that experiences a sexual-emotional rush at the thought or experience of not being in control of this practice. He therefore actively seeks out another (Party B) who he can share his wife’s pictures with who will then “take over” and be “in control” of what they do with those pictures.

This emotional-sexual rush Party A gets is related to the rush a cuckold gets at no longer having any say or control over what his wife will or will not do (to use an analogy, candaulism is to candaulism-by-proxy as being a stag/hotwife husband is to being a cuckold). Indeed, some who engage in candaulism-by-proxy actually ask/beseech/beg Party B not to post/show/expose his wife any more, while secretly behind the scenes giving Party B more pictures to do just that with.



Party A enjoys the experience of not being able to do anything about it. He craves the feeling of no longer being in control, of being forced to endure whatever consequences may befall him. He gets his true thrill in being in the passenger seat with someone else at the wheel. For these types of men, sometimes it’s nice to just…let…go.

I bring this up because it’s become an especially relevant topic at The Cuckold Consultant site’s newly launched cuckold and hotwife chatroom _[Cuckold Chat](https://www.thecuckoldconsultant.com/cuckold-chat/). _Just as some men look for bulls or cuckoldresses or dominatrices to dominate, control, or humiliate them in some kind of consensual “non-consensual” way, so will some look for others to take control of their pictures and post/expose for them so they can sit back and “helplessly” watch (said: enjoy) the show.

Here at Cuckold Chat, candaulism-by-proxy is acceptable and allowed. However, we do ask that if you’re going to engage in this behavior, you follow a few guidelines:

- If you’re going to repost someone else’s pics, make sure you have their permission to do so, and make sure they’re currently in the chatroom when you do.
-  If you want someone else to repost your pics, don’t ask over and over in public chat. Space your requests out so you don’t come across as “spammy”.
- As per the rules of the site: if another user is re-posting your pictures and you are someone who does not like when anyone else re-posts your pictures, please private message the poster and kindly ask them to stop. If they do not stop after the first time you ask them, please contact a mod.

If you see another user publicly complaining or begging someone else to stop posting their pics, don’t assume they need help or assistance. Assume it’s all part of a consensual non-consensual arrangement. If it’s not and that person does have a legitimate issue, all they need to do is report their issue to staff who will take care of it.
